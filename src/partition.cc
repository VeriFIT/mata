/** @file partition.cc
 *  @brief Definition of a partition
 *
 *  In this context, we consider a carrier set S which contains all
 *  natural numbers from 0 to |S|-1 and nothing else. These numbers are called
 *  states.
 *  Then, partition over S is a set of blocks such that:
 *  - each block contains only states
 *  - each state is represented in exactly one block
 *     - blocks are disjoint
 *     - there is no state which is not represented in any block
 *  - no block is empty
 *
 *  This file provides implementation of a partition P which allows us to:
 *  - find the block which contains a given state in O(1)
 *  - find a representative state of the given block in O(1)
 *  - test whether two states share the same block in O(1)
 *  - test whether all states in a vector A share the same block in O(|A|)
 *  - iterate through the block B in O(|B|)
 *  - iterate through the node N in O(|N|)
 *  - split the whole partition such that each block
 *    is split in two pieces or remains unchanged in O(|S|)
 *  - remember all ancestors of current blocks and access them if necessary
 *    so we can manipulate multiple generations of a partition (before and
 *    after it has been split)

/** Constructor of the partition object. This method reserves memory space
* for the vectors used to represent partition to ensure us that they won't
* ever be moved in the memory when extended. The maximal sizes of these vectors
* can be computed using the num_of_states parameter.
* The partition can be initialized in linear time (in respect to the carrier
* set of the partition) using initial partition represented as a vector of 
* vectors of states.
* The constructor works as follows:
* - if there is any nonexisting state in the initial partition, the construction
*   fails (state >= num_of_states)
* - if there are duplicates in the initial partition, the construction fails
* - if there is an empty partition class, the construction fails
* - if there are states which are not represented in the initial partition,
*   they will be all part of the one additional block
* If there is no initial partition, all states will be assigned 
* to the same block

* - if there is a block whose all elements are unmarked, the block remains
* unchanged
* - if there is a block which contains both marked and unmarked states, it

* and the second one contains unmarked states of the original block
* - it means that each block is either unchanged or split in two parts
* - if a block contains states such that corresponding BlockItems form
* contiguous subvector on the interval of natural numbers <a, b>, the split
* nodes will correspond to such BlockItems that they form contiguous subvectors
* on the intervals of natural numbers <a, k> and <k+1, b>, where a <= k < b.

* changes its position.
* Moreover, the node corresponding to the ancestor of the two split blocks
* will still describe a valid contiguous interval of natural numbers <a, b>.
* - if an nonexisting state is used, the function detects it and fails
