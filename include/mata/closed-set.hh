/** @file closed_set.hh
 *  @brief Definition of a closed set
 *
 *  This file contains definition of a closed set and function which
 *  allow us to work with them (membership, inclusion, union, intersection)
 *
 *
 * Description:
 * In this context, an upward-closed set is a set of sets of elements of type T,
 * (set of nodes of type T, where a node is a set of elements of type T)
 * where the elements come from the discrete range <min_val; max_val>. If the upward
 * closed set contains a subset A of the range <min_val; max_val>, it also contains
 * all the supersets of A (in context of the discrete range <min_val; max_val>).
 * Thus, the upward closed set could be easily represented by its 1) type (upward closed),
 * 2) discrete range borders (min_val, max_val), 3) its antichain.
 * Analogously, a downward closed set contains all the subsets of the antichain elements.
 *
 * It is possible to:
 *
 * -> ==- and !=-compare two closed sets
 * -> <=- and >=-compare two closed sets of the same type
 * -> get a text representation of the closed set
 * -> chceck whether the closed set contains a given node/nodes
 * -> insert a node/more nodes to the closed set
 * -> perform an union over two closed sets of the same type and with the same carrier
 * -> perform an intersection over two closed sets of the same type and with the same carrier
 *
 * It is not possible to:
 *
 * -> choose a custom carrier which is not a discrete range <min_val; max_val>
 * -> <=- and >=-compare two closed sets of the different types (nonsense)
 * -> remove a node/more nodes from the closed set (nonsense)
 * -> perform an union over two closed sets of different types or different carriers (nonsense)
 * -> perform an intersection over two closed sets of different types or different carriers (nonsense) 
 * -> compute a complement of a closed set (TODO)
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Let us have the carrier {0, 1, 2, 3} and the upward-closed set with the antichain 
 * {{0}, {1, 2}}. We can write↑{{0}, {1, 2}} = {{0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {0, 3}, {0, 1, 2},
 * {0, 1, 3}, {0, 2, 3}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {0, 1, 2, 3}}.
 *
 * Let us have the carrier {0, 1, 2, 3} and the downward-closed set with the antichain 
 * {{0}, {1, 2}}. We can write ↓{{0}, {1, 2}} = {{0}, {1, 2}, {1}, {2}, {}}.
