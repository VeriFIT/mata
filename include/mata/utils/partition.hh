 *  @brief Definition of a partition
 *
 *  In this context, we consider a carrier set S which contains all
 *  natural numbers from 0 to |S|-1 and nothing else. These numbers are called
 *  states.
 *  Then, partition over S is a set of blocks such that:
 *  - each block contains only states
 *  - each state is represented in exactly one block
 *     - blocks are disjoint
 *     - there is no state which is not represented in any block
 *  - no block is empty
 *
 *  This file provides implementation of a partition P which allows us to:
 *  - find the block which contains a given state in O(1)
 *  - find a representative state of the given block in O(1)
 *  - test whether two states share the same block in O(1)
 *  - test whether all states in a vector A share the same block in O(|A|)
 *  - iterate through the block B in O(|B|)
 *  - iterate through the node N in O(|N|)
 *  - split the whole partition such that each block
 *    is split in two pieces or remains unchanged in O(|S|)
 *  - remember all ancestors of current blocks and access them if necessary
 *    so we can manipulate multiple generations of a partition (before and
 *    after it has been split)

/**
 * @class Partition
 * @brief Partition of a set of states
 *
 * This data structure provides a partition of a set of states S. In this
 * context, the term 'state' refers to any natural number from the
 * interval <0, |S|-1>.
 *
 * This representation defines:
 * - states - element from a consecutive interval of natural numbers
 * - blocks - objects which represent the current generation of the partition.
 *            Each block refers to several states which belong to the block.
 *            The block could be possibly split.
 * - nodes  - objects which represent blocks either from the current generation
 *            of the partition or the block from the previous generations of
 *            the partition (block which had been split). Once a node is
 *            created, it is never changed. When a block is split, two new nodes
 *            are created.
 * - block items
 *          - objects which serve as intermediate data structure between states
 *            and blocks. Each block item contains indices of both corresponding
 *            state and block. Block items are sorted in such way that one could
 *            iterate through each block B or each node N in the O(B) or O(N)
 *            time, respectively.  
 * 
 * Detailed explanation:
 *
 * STATES:
 * States are represented by indices of the vector 'states_' with the
 * unchangeable size |S|. Each element of the vector represents the state
 * by its order in the 'states_' vector. The vector itself contains indices
 * of corresponding block items. Index of the block item corresponding
 * to the state 's' could be get in constant time using 'states_[s]'. 
 *
 * BLOCK ITEMS:
 * Block items are stored in the 'block_items_' vector of the unchangeable size
 * |S|. The block item can by accessed by its index using 
 * block_items[block_item_idx]. Each block item contains its index (which is
 * always the same as its order in the 'block_items_' vector but
 * it is stored directly in the object to simplify manipulations with
 * the partition). It also contains the index of its corresponding state
 * which means that states and block items are bijectively mapped. 
 * In addition, each BlockItem includes an index of the corresponding partition
 * block.
 * The ordering of 'block_items_' vector satisfies the condition that the states
 * of the same block (or node) should always form a contiguous subvector so one
 * could iterate through states in each block (or node) efficiently using
 * 'block_items' vector.
 *
 * BLOCKS:
 * The blocks themselves are represented by the vector 'blocks_' with the
 * size |P|, where P is a partition of states. Each block can be accessed by
 * its index 0 <= i < |P|. The block can by accessed by its index using 
 * blocks_[block_idx]. The block contains an index of itself and an index of its 
 * corresponding node. The total number of blocks can be changed as soon as
 * one block is split. However, the maximal number of blocks is equal to |S|
 * (the case when each block contains only one state). When a block 'B' is
 * split in two pieces 'B1' and 'B2', we create a brand new block 'B2' 
 * and modify the former block 'B' such that it will correspond to its
 * subblock 'B1'. The former block 'B' is thus not represented
 * in the 'blocks_' vector anymore since 'B1' takes over its identity.
 *
 * NODES:
 * Each node represents a current block or a block which has been split before.
 * The node can by accessed by its index using nodes_[node_idx]. If the given
 * node represents an existing block, such block contains an index of that node.
 * In context of nodes which represent former blocks, no block contains their
 * indices. The total number of nodes can be changed as soon as
 * one block is split. In such situation, two new nodes (which represent both
 * new blocks) are created and the former node remains unchanged. Therefore, the
 * maximal number of nodes is equal to 2 * |S| - 1 since once a node is created,
 * it is never changed. Each node contains its own index and two indices of
 * block items (namely 'first' and 'last') which could be used to access
 * block items corresponding to the first and last block items which form a   
 * contiguous subvector of 'block_items_' vector included in such node.
 * When a block is split, the corresponding block items are swapped 
 * in situ such that the indices 'first' and 'last' still surround the
 * corresponding node and both new nodes also point to the contiguous subvector
 * of its block items.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * In the example below, we represent a partition {{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}}
 * which had been split to the partition {{0, 2}, {1, 3, 4}}.
 * Thus, we have two blocks: 0 ({0, 2}) and 1 ({1, 3, 4}) which form the current
 * generation of the partition.
 * We also have three nodes: 0 ({0, 1, 2, 3, 4}), 1 ({0, 2}) and 2 ({1, 3, 4})
 * which represent both current generation of the partition and also block which
 * does not exist anymore since it had been split.
 * The block 0 corresponds to the node 1 and the block 1 corresponds to the 
 * node 2.
 * The node 1 contains indices 0 (first) and 1 (last) which means that
 * the blockItems 0 and 1 surround a contiguous subvector of elements in the 
 * node 1 (or in the block 0).
 * Likewise, the node 2 contains indices 2 (first) and 4 (last) which means that
 * the blockItems 2 and 4 surround a contiguous subvector of elements in the
 * node 2 (or in the block 1).
 * Moreover, we also represent the former block which does not exist anymore
 * by the node 0 which contains indices 0 (first) and 4 (last) which means that
 * the blockItems 0 and 4 surround a contiguous subvector of elements in the 
 * node 0. Thus, we know that there had been a block {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} before 
 * it has been split to obtain blocks {0, 2} and {1, 3, 4}.
 * In the picture below, indices of vectors are depicted outside of the vectors.
